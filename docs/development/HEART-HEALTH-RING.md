# Dungeon heart health ring

## Behaviour

The green ring of the heart badge in the top-left corner (next to the mana number) shows the
health of the local player's dungeon heart. It is drawn clockwise from 15 degrees over
`330 * healthFraction` degrees, so a full ring ends at 345 degrees and leaves a small gap at
the top. The unlit part stays as a dark groove. A destroyed heart (fraction 0) shows no green.
While the heart is under attack the badge glows magenta behind the silver heart; the glow is
switched off after 3 seconds without a further message and never shows on a destroyed heart.

`healthFraction` is the remaining heart health divided by the health of an undamaged heart,
`RoomDungeonTemple::getHeartMaxHP` (`getHeartHealthFraction`). The gold badge is not changed.

## How it works

- The badges are still generated procedurally at start-up by `createNavigationImages` in
  `source/render/Gui.cpp`, now through `drawBadgePixels`. `Gui::updateHeartBadge` draws the
  heart badge again and writes it with `blitFromMemory` into the existing texture (`ManaBadge`),
  so the layout, the image scaling, the tooltips and the resource strip are unchanged. It first
  used `loadFromMemory`: the CEGUI Ogre renderer then makes a new Ogre texture, while the badge
  window keeps drawing the Ogre texture stored in its cached geometry, so the ring never moved.
- The rules (arc, one-point step, glow timer) are in `source/game/HeartHealthRing.h`.
- New server notification `heartHealth` (last value of `ServerNotificationType`):
  `float healthFraction`, `bool underAttack`, sent to the owning human player only.
- `notifyHeartHealth` in `source/network/ODServer.cpp` runs once per turn for every client. It
  sends when the fraction changed by at least one percentage point since the previous message,
  when the heart is destroyed, and once for a client that has not been told anything yet,
  which covers a new game and a loaded game. `underAttack` is true when the health fell since
  the previous message.
- `ODClient` keeps the state (`HeartHealthRing::BadgeState`), resets it on `clientAccepted`, and
  `GameMode::onFrameStarted` runs the glow timer and redraws the badge when needed.

## Verification and limits

`source/tests/check_heart_health_ring.py` compiles the production rules, `notifyHeartHealth`,
the heart health and save methods and `drawBadgePixels` into a fixture. It checks the arc
for 0, 10, 50 and 100 percent, clamping, the one-point rule, the human-owner-only delivery, the
payload order, the glow timer, a save and load round trip and the wiring in the client and the
game mode. On Windows, application control sometimes blocks freshly compiled fixtures (error
4551); the script retries four times.
`source/tests/check_heart_badge_texture.py` runs the real `updateHeartBadge` with the CEGUI Ogre
renderer in a hidden window: it reproduces that `loadFromMemory` replaces the Ogre texture, and
reads back that the update keeps the texture and holds the ring of the new health.

Not verified: how the badge looks in the running game. The magenta glow strength and the
dark groove colour are estimates. Hits smaller than one percentage point in total are not
sent, so a very slow attack lights the glow only at each full point.
