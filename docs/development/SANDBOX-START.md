# Sandbox start state

The sandbox level (`levels/skirmish/Sandbox.level`, mode code in `source/gamemap/SandboxMode.cpp`)
does not start with everything researched.

- Available at the start: Treasury, Dormitory (the lair), Hatchery and the worker summon spell
  (`roomTreasury`, `roomDormitory`, `roomHatchery`, `spellSummonWorker` in the `[SkillDone]` list of the seat).
- Rooms: the other base rooms become available one after the other. Order: Library, Training Hall,
  Wooden Bridge, Guard Room, Workshop, Prison, Torture Chamber, Temple, Crypt, Casino, Arena, Stone Bridge.
  The first message of the game tells the player about the starting rooms; each unlock goes through
  `Seat::addSkill`, so the player gets the usual "... is now available." notice.
- Delay: `SandboxRoomUnlockIntervalSeconds` in `config/rooms.cfg` (default 120 seconds between two rooms,
  counted in game time). The first room comes after one interval. The interval is a plain default that can be
  changed in the file.
- Spells and traps are researched in the library as usual (nothing of them is researched at the start).
- A room the level already lists in `[SkillDone]` (or that was researched in the meantime) is skipped, so a
  level with all rooms researched has nothing to unlock. `levels/skirmish/SandboxEverything.level` is such a
  variant: every base room and the full spell and trap set are available from the start, there is no timer.
- The unlock progress is not saved: a loaded game starts again from the first room that is not yet available.
