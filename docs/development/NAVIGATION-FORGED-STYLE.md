# Forged minimap and corner controls

## Goal

The dungeon heart and gold badge in the top left corner use a forged look: blackened iron with
grain, a bronze edge line, bronze rivets, lit materials and warm glow tones. The minimap in the
lower left was still a thin silver ring around a black disc with cold blue-grey corner panels and
thin outline symbols. It now uses the same look. Behaviour is unchanged: clicks, tooltips, hit
tests, the map image, the view trapezoid, the direction line and click navigation keep their code.

## What is drawn where

Everything is drawn procedurally in `source/render/Gui.cpp` (`createMiniMapCornerImages`), in the
style and with the helpers of `drawBadgePixels` (`badgeSet`, `badgeMix`, `badgeFbm`, `badgeNormal`
and so on). No image asset is added. All light comes from the top left, like the badges.

- **Frame** (`OpenDungeonsIcons/MiniMapRim`, 384 px, 2x2 samples): an iron ring 8.4 layout units
  wide with a dark contour, a bronze edge line, sixteen domed bronze rivets and a bright bronze
  inner lip. Inside the ring lies a translucent warm stone haze (grain from smooth noise) that
  darkens towards the ring and under the upper left edge. The black of unexplored ground reads as
  dark stone and the map colours stay readable, because the haze is only 13 to 22 percent opaque
  in the middle. The map texture itself, which is opaque, is not touched.
- **Compass marker** (`OpenDungeonsIcons/MiniMapNorth`): a bronze boss with a dark well and a raised
  gold N replaces the white font glyph. It still moves to the north direction of the rotated map,
  now on the inner part of the ring.
- **Corner plates** (`MiniMapCorner0` to `3`, plus `...Hover` and `...Pressed`, 128 px, 3x3
  samples): a blackened iron plate with a bevel, a bronze edge line, two rivets and a bronze
  medallion around a dark well, cut by the map circle exactly as before. The hovered plate has a
  gold bezel, glowing embers in the well and an ember halo on the plate; the pressed plate is
  sunk in with inverted lighting. They are used by `OD/MiniMapCornerButton`
  (`CornerHoverBackground` and `CornerPushedBackground`, set in `ModeGame.layout`).
- **Symbols** (`NavHelp`, `NavSell`, `NavOptions`, `MapZoom`, 64 px, 3x3 samples): embossed gold
  question mark, a steel bomb with a bronze cap, rope fuse and glowing spark (still the Sell
  button), a gold gear with recessed dots (Options) and a gold magnifier with a dark glass and a
  bronze grip (minimap zoom). The game options window and chat still use the old `HelpIcon` and
  `OptionsIcon`.

`MiniMap.cpp` only draws the two images instead of the old grey bands and the font glyph; the
frame is drawn after the map layers, as before.

## Verification

`source/tests/check_navigation_style_textures.py` cuts the drawing functions out of `Gui.cpp`,
builds them with the compiler of the environment and checks the geometry (172 checks): the frame
is opaque on the ring and clear in the map area, the plates mirror each other exactly and are
empty where the map circle cuts them, hover is warmer and pressed not brighter than resting,
every symbol has an opaque body, warm metal, a glint and stays inside its texture. With
`--preview DIRECTORY` it also writes enlarged textures and a mock-up at the size of the 1920x1200
game (176 units at scale 1.7). The generated previews of this change were inspected at that size
and enlarged, also placed on a real game screenshot. `check_navigation_icon_shading.py`,
`check_selected_room_highlight.py`, `check_heart_health_ring.py` and
`check_heart_badge_texture.py` still pass.

Not verified: the look inside the running game (the game was not built or started for this
change), the colour blending of the haze over the real map texture beyond the screenshot mock-up,
and the hover and pressed states of the plates as CEGUI draws them.

## Not changed

The category buttons, the tab panel and the two buttons above the minimap (production and
research) still use the shared navigation frame of `OD/GameTabButton`. Restyling them touches
every tab and panel of the game and is left for a separate change. The map does not show fixed
compass ticks: the map can rotate, so a fixed graduation would point in the wrong directions.
