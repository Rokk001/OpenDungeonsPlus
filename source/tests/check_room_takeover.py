"""Workers take over enemy rooms only when nobody guards them, and the taker can be charged.

Pure source wiring checks (no compiler, no game): server authority, configuration with defaults,
the guard and price rules in Room, their use in Tile (both the search check and the dance), the
client reactions. The probe of the two pure rules in RoomClaim.h is compiled and run only with
--probe (needs the MSVC compiler on the path)."""
