"""Check that the profile remarks (QuirksText) never move the status and the latest post and are never cut off.

Static check, no game needed. Two things are verified.

1. Order. The rows of the profile page flow from top to bottom (Gui::layoutCreatureProfilePage). The remarks of
   the picture come after status and latest post, so those two keep the position they have without remarks.
2. Overflow. The creature card has a fixed height and the Dungeonbook pane is limited too. If the rows are
   higher than the page, the page scrolls: the page layout holds a scrollbar that is shown only then, and
   layoutCreatureProfilePage moves all rows with it (so nothing is cut off without a way to reach it).

The height model: fonts and layout are scaled by the same factor, both from the display size and the user
scale (the font is autoscaled from 800x600, the layout from 1024x768, the same ratio), so the heights in design
pixels do not depend on the resolution. This is computed per resolution and per user scale below to show it.
A text line of the 8 point font is about 14 pixels at 800x600, that is 18 design pixels; a row is its lines plus
4 pixels padding and 4 pixels gap.
