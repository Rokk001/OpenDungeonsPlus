"""Checks that a seat cannot cast spells while its library is lost (task M10c). It does not start a game.

The rule is checked on the sources: the seat remembers that it once had a library, the server
refuses spells without one, the flag reaches the clients with the other changing seat data, and
the spell buttons are locked on the client.
