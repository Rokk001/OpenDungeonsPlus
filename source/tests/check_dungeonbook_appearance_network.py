"""Check the wiring of the Dungeonbook appearance in the network code without a game.

The server is authoritative: the appearance travels once with the full creature data
(exportToPacket / importFromPacket), never with the per-turn update, and a later assignment is
announced with one notification. The client only takes the appearance over.
