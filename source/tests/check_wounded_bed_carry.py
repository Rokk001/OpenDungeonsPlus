"""Workers pull hurt creatures into their bed by the legs.

Pure source wiring checks (no compiler, no game): server authority, configuration, one worker per creature, abort
rules, the creature is pulled over the ground (never put into the carry node of the worker), the movement of the
two (speed, direction, path), the clip names with their fallbacks, nothing new to save or send, the client
reactions. The carrying of things that are really carried (gold, bodies, prisoners, traps) must stay as it was."""
