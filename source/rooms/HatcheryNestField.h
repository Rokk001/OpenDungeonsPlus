//! \brief Places of the straw nests that lie scattered over a hatchery. The places are computed from the tiles of the
//! hatchery, the tiles of its coops and its entrances alone, with integer hashes of the tile coordinates and no random numbers, so
//! the places do not depend on the order of the tiles. Only the server computes them and sends them to the clients (ServerNotificationType::hatcheryNests). The header has no dependency on the
//! game map, so it can be tested alone (a python port of the rules is in the check scripts).
//!
//! Rules (see Settings for the numbers): a nest lies on a tile of the hatchery, at least mEdge from every tile that is
//! not part of the hatchery (walls, other rooms), at least mCoopClearance from the footprint of every coop, outside
//! of the apron in front of the ramp of every coop (the way the animals walk to it), at least mPathClearance from the
//! walking strips (half width mPathHalfWidth) that lead from the middle of every entrance tile to the apron of every
//! coop, and at least mSpacing from every other nest. An entrance is a tile of the hatchery that lies next to a
//! walkable tile that is not part of it (door, corridor, other room); the caller finds them (see
//! RoomHatchery::collectEntrances) from the fullness of the tiles and the doors on them (the server alone). There is about one nest per mTilesPerNest tiles (at most mMaxNests), but at least one per coop.
