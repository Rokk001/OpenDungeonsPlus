//! Nothing here depends on the renderer. The server turns the gold of a tile and of its
//! neighbours into a mesh name (the name of the pile object it already replicates to the
//! clients, so no extra packet is needed and old clients or saves are not affected), and the
//! client builds the mesh behind that name from the same description.
