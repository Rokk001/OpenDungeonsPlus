 * - the result of a melee blow (dodged, glancing, strong) as reactions of the attacker and the target and a short
 *   trail behind the weapon after a strong blow,
 * - the arrow or bolt of archers: it lies on the string or the rail while an enemy is near, is drawn slowly, leaves
 *   at the moment the server launches the missile (the missile entity is the same arrow) and a new one is taken or
 *   loaded a moment later.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the game: no animation state, no activity, no refresh and no message is sent. The arrow is
 * an extra entity on the bone of the bow and exists only in the option 'Creature reactions: full'.
