/*! \brief Cosmetic one-shot reactions of creatures (cheering, surprise, ...), client side only.
 *
 * A reaction is an overlay on what the creature does: it never changes the animation state the
 * server decided on, the creature activity or anything that is sent over the network. Each client
 * triggers the reactions on its own from what it already knows, and chooses the variants on its own.
 *
 * Every variant is shown in the highest tier available: a clip made for the reaction, else a clip
 * of the mesh, always together with an emote icon, particles and a short procedural motion. A
 * missing clip, icon or particle effect only leads to the next tier (and one log line).
