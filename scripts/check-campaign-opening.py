"""Opening check for campaign levels: the first minute must not be decided by the layout.

For every level the state at the START of the game is checked (no trigger has fired yet):

1. Enemy walk path. The sources of the enemy team are the creatures of other teams, their
   wave portals, their portals and their dungeon temples. For every source the walk path
   to the dungeon temple of the human seat is measured (4-neighbourhood, like the game):
   only over tiles that can be walked right now (open dirt, claimed or built tiles, rooms,
   bridges, doors; doors count as walkable). Every such connection is a FAIL, whatever its
   length: a source must always have to dig to reach the temple. Solid rock, water and lava
   never count as passable. A tile that is rock at the start and opened later by a trigger
   therefore separates, as it should. The shortest path that may also cross solid dirt,
   gold and gem tiles is only reported (shortest_dig_path) and has no threshold. Levels
   outside the campaign (skirmish, realms) are exempt from this part.

2. Open areas between the rooms of the human seat. Within OPEN_RADIUS tiles of the temple
   and within the bounding box of all rooms of the human seat, a square of at least
   OPEN_SQUARE x OPEN_SQUARE walkable (not dug) tiles that belong to no room, i.e. an open
   area larger than 4x4, is a large empty hall: FAIL (the largest one is reported with
   its corner). Furthermore, rooms
   placed for the human seat must be separated from each other by rock: two such rooms
   that touch each other, or a block of WIDE_PASSAGE x WIDE_PASSAGE open non-room tiles
   next to one of them (passage wider than MAX_PASSAGE_WIDTH), is a FAIL.

3. Safe zone around heart and nearest portal (SAFE_RADIUS, default 20 tiles, option
   --safe-radius N). The seat of the human player must be able to build up before it has
   to fight. The zone is every tile that is at most SAFE_RADIUS tiles away, over walkable
   and diggable tiles (dirt, gold, gem, rooms, doors; rock, water and lava block), from the
   dungeon heart, from the nearest portal or from the dig path between the two. Portals of
   that seat count, and so do unclaimed portals (owner seat 0) because the player claims
   them on the way.
   Inside the zone there must be no creature of an enemy seat (other team; neutral seat 0
   does not count), no trap or door of an enemy seat, no room of an enemy seat, no wave
   portal of an enemy seat and no script spawn action of an enemy seat whose spawn position
   lies in the zone (triggered or not). A level without such a portal is only
   checked around the heart. Applies to every level with a human (or, failing that,
   a choice) seat, campaign or not.

Output is one line per level (PASS or FAIL, file, numbers). Levels listed in
scripts/check-campaign-opening.allowlist report FAIL but do not change the exit code
("known, to be fixed"); the exit code is 0 only if every level passes or is allowlisted.
This script contains no level data.

Usage:
  check-campaign-opening.py [--no-allowlist] [--safe-radius N] [--full] [--all] [<file> ...]
  check-campaign-opening.py --self-test

Without files all levels of levels/campaign/Campaign.cfg are checked; --all checks every
level file below levels/ (campaign, skirmish, multiplayer). --full lists every violation
(by default at most MAX_EXAMPLES examples per kind). A summary block ends the output.
