# Concrete portrait findings

Per-file findings; placement corrections do not prove source regeneration is required.

## Kobold.mesh - build-1-slim.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The source ends at the upper arms and upper torso; registered shoulder shading and contour transitions remain visible at native size.

Cause: The existing source covers only the upper torso, whereas the neutral base contains the complete visible body.

Required action: Check the derived body transition beneath the available clothing and both body options.

Evidence: Kobold.mesh/review/combined-1.png

## Dwarf1.mesh - hair-1-braid.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The hair source includes a complete moustache and beard plus the side braid.

Cause: The generated hair asset contains more than the intended hair-slot content.

Required action: Retain the side braid using the recorded derived alpha polygon; inspect the temple attachment.

Evidence: ../generated-features/Dwarf1.mesh/hair-1-braid.png

Resolution: Both hair roots feathered on derived copies; separate brooch and necklace anchors retained, necklace cord fitted behind the beard union. All delivered options checked in native panels and twelve 50x100 composites.

## Dwarf1.mesh - neck-2-tooth.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The necklace shared the right-chest brooch anchor.

Cause: Two accessories with different attachment locations used one centred transform.

Required action: Use the separate neck-centred transform already recorded for this option and inspect beneath the beard.

Evidence: Dwarf1.mesh/review/combined-2.png

Resolution: Both hair roots feathered on derived copies; separate brooch and necklace anchors retained, necklace cord fitted behind the beard union. All delivered options checked in native panels and twelve 50x100 composites.

Final evidence: ../../variants/Dwarf1.mesh/review/native-body-check.jpg

## Dwarf1.mesh-female - chin-1-square.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

Surrounding skin boundaries remain visible below the mouth in the individual overview.

Cause: Different source skin shading meets the neutral face at the patch contour.

Required action: Inspect and adjust the derived contour feathering with all mouth variants.

Evidence: Dwarf1.mesh-female/review/overview.jpg

Resolution: Transparent padded alpha filtering removes the rectangular patch boundaries; all delivered options were inspected in native face/body panels and all twelve 50x100 composites.

Final evidence: ../../variants/Dwarf1.mesh-female/review/native-face-check.jpg

Cause: Scar is drawn after ears and its current alpha extended into the ear area.

Required action: Move the scar into the cheek and bake alpha avoidance against all ear and hair options; inspect the literal manifest composite.

Evidence: ../variants/Orc.mesh-female/review/combined-1.png

Resolution: Derived scar placement avoids the ear root; padded alpha feathering removes the mouth boundary. Every delivered option reviewed at native scale and in twelve 50x100 composites.

Final evidence: ../../variants/Orc.mesh-female/review/native-face-check.jpg

## Orc.mesh-female - mouth-1-tusks.png

## Knight.mesh-female - outfit-1-plate-build0.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The new armor leaves neutral forearm wedges visible at both sides between rows 1250 and 1550.

Cause: The generated sleeve openings are larger than the neutral forearm outline.

Required action: Correct the new clothing source to cover the existing neutral arms; preserve the base and all existing feature sources.

Evidence: Knight.mesh-female/review/outfits/outfit-1-plate-build0.png

## Goblin.mesh - chin-1-forked.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The native composite has a hard skin transition at the upper jaw patch.

Cause: Source contour and neutral geometry differ at this attachment.

Required action: Feather the derived jaw alpha and check both chin options with all mouth options.

Evidence: Goblin.mesh/review/combined-1.png

Resolution: Padded face feathering, crown anchoring and wider continuous garment registration remove the documented boundaries and exposed arm strips; all options reviewed at native size and 50x100.

Final evidence: ../../variants/Goblin.mesh/review/native-body-check.jpg

## Goblin.mesh - outfit-1-patched-build0.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

## Cultist.mesh-female - helmet-1-crest.png

Status: closed-native-and-50x100

The literal combined review shows a dark gap between the helmet lower edge and the robe collar; inspect all four helmet options against both builds.

Cause: Existing helmet registration and the new robe collar do not share the neutral head and neck anchors.

## Option geometry review

All 34 catalogs were inspected at original size and 50x100. Every one of the 688 registered options occurs in the review combinations and retains visible pixels. Coverage does not imply exhaustive Cartesian acceptance. Existing source images, base images, helmets and saved previews remain unchanged. Prior findings and provenance above are retained.
